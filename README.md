# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). 
This application is really useful for internet users . In a few clicks you can shorten the URL. If you accidently made any mistakes you can edit your URL in a few seconds. Tiny App is easy to use and super user friendly. Tiny App will not allow anyone else to see your URL list. For user convenience there are Edit and Delete buttons, which allow you to keep your URL list organized.

And last but not least, your password will stay safe as we use encrypted cookies and hash passwords.
